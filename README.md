## âœ¨ What is CSVantage?
CSVantage is a **Linux CLI application** built in **C** that performs **CRUD** operations on CSV files. 
This is an excellent tool for simple data manipulation and management.

## ðŸ”Ž What can CSVantage do?
CSVantage allows users to interact with CSV files through a user-friendly command line interface without the need for SQL commands. Here's what you can accomplish with CSVantage:

- **Create New CSV Files**: Start from scratch and create new CSV files, adding fields as you go.
- **Load Existing CSV Files**: Open any CSV file in the same directory as the application to perform operations.
- **CRUD Operations**: 
  - **Create**: Add new rows and columns to your CSV files.
  - **Read**: You can read and display specific lines, columns, the entire table, or check if a particular value exists in the table.
  - **Update**: Utilize a simple find and replace feature, or a more targeted update where a specific value in a row can trigger an update to another value in the same row (e.g., updating the 'salary' field when the employee's name is 'Mark').
  - **Delete**: Remove specific rows, entire columns, or the entire CSV file if no longer needed.
  
These operations straightforward and require no prior database knowledge.

## ðŸš€ Installation Process
